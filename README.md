# Blossom Algorithm

Implementation and Visualization of the Blossom algorithm to construct a maximum matching in any graph. The blossom algorithm is a polynomial time maximum graph matching algorithm that has a complexity O(|V||E<sup>2</sup>|).

## Prerequisites and Setup 
Make sure you're running python 3.6.x

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Algorithm

To run the algorithm, in your terminal, enter

```
$python main.py
```

Press `enter` to update graph.
